              <li>Information which you provide to us voluntarily. For example, we collect the Personal Information you provide us when you register for a trial of the Ensure system; if you place purchases; when you submit or upload such Personal Information; and/or when you contact us directly. If you provide us with Personal Information, other than your own, we will treat that information as yours, and assume that you have attained the authorisation to upload the information on behalf of the user.</li>

              <li>We collect information which you provide to us voluntarily. </li>
            </ol>
            &nbsp;
            <h3>4. Why Do We Collect Such Information?</h3>
            <p><b>We collect such Non-personal and Personal Information for the following purposes:</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>To provide and operate the Services;</li>
              <li>To provide our Users with ongoing customer assistance and technical support;</li>
              <li>To be able to contact our Visitors and Users with general or personalized service-related notices and promotional messages (as further detailed in Section 8 below);</li>
              <li>To create aggregated statistical data and other aggregated and/or inferred Non-personal Information, which we may use to provide and improve our service;</li>

            </ol>

Such Third Party Services may receive or otherwise have access to the Personal Information, in its entirety or in part – depending on each of their particular roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services and business, and may only use it for such purposes. Note that while our Services may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for such websites’ or services’ privacy practices, and encourage you to be aware when you leave our Services and read the privacy statements of each and every website and service you visit. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked third-party websites and services. Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. is accountable for personal data that it receives from you. Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. remains responsible and liable if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, unless Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. <b style="color: #000;">6.2. Law Enforcement, Legal Requests and Duties:</b> Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. may disclose or otherwise allow others access to your Personal Information pursuant to a legal request, such as a subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in compliance with applicable laws, if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so, with or without notice to you. <b style="color: #000;">6.3 Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies:</b> We may share Personal Information internally within our family of companies, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

In addition, should Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. or any of its affiliates undergo any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your Personal Information may be shared with the parties involved in such event. If we have a good faith belief that such change in control might materially affect your Personal Information then stored with us, we will notify you via e-mail and/or prominent notice on our Website of this event and certain choices you may have regarding your Personal Information. For the avoidance of doubt, Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. may share your Personal Information in manners other than as described above, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so.</p>

            <h3>11. Security</h3>
            <p>Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to all areas on our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection; and we regularly maintain a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification. We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy. However – regardless of the measures and efforts taken by Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information, Information you upload or otherwise share with Ensure Endpoint Technologies Inc. or anyone else. We therefore encourage you to enable our 2-factor authentication system for your User Account and avoid providing us with any sensitive information which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm. Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services may be less secure than others, and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any Personal Information or passwords on any of these areas or via any of these methods. If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are more than welcome to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ensureendpoint.com">info@ensureendpoint.com</a></p>

            <p>Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs and communities. Be aware that any information you provide in any such areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blogs, communities or forums, feel free to contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@ensureendpoint.com">info@ensureendpoint.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information from such areas. For example, if you use a third-party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you will need to login into such application or contact its provider if you want to have the Personal Information you posted through it removed. In any event, we recommend that you do not post any information (or use any posting means to post information) you would not want to be made public on these areas.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <h3>13. Terms of Use, Updates and Interpretation</h3>
