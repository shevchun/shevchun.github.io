              <p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 has set the stage for a lot of changes in Healthcare in the U.S. in the last decade. When combined with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, organizations dealing with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI, also referred to as the “the information” in this document) need to put technical controls in place to ensure the security and privacy of patient data or face severe consequences ranging from making public acknowledgement of data exposure and paying steep fines (currently up to $1.5 million for noncompliance), to the loss of government payments for care (such as from Medicare or Medicaid).</p>
              <p>AlertSec provides a solid foundation on which you can build your compliance program. Today, most organizations that deal with medical information use some sort of electronic health care system that combines the many facets of patient care, from intake and visits to follow-up care and billing, and these systems are generally designed for compliance. To provide complete coverage of the ePHI technical protection needed for HIPAA compliance, you need to protect more than just the Healthcare System itself. Any systems where patient data could be accessed or stored must be protected, and this is where the AlertSec Service plays a critical part.</p>
              <p><b>AlertSec Service features:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li><b style="color: #000;">Protect –</b> Safeguard all ePHI on computers and removable media (USB sticks/drives etc.)</li>
                <li><b style="color: #000;">Comply –</b> with HIPAA and HITECH Enforcement Rule through Policy Control</li>
                <li><b style="color: #000;">Manage –</b> Deploy and monitor compliance through a cloud management tool</li>
              </ul>
              &nbsp;
              <h2>Building HIPAA Compliance</h2>
              <p>When approaching HIPAA Compliance for your organization it is important to look at your overall compliance “story”. The HIPAA and HITECH Acts lay out the penalties for ePHI disclosure but also provide mechanisms for Safe Harbor against breaches when certain conditions are met.</p>
              <p>To claim an Affirmative Defense the key is to be able to show the overall compliance coverage within your organization, explaining the Administrative, Physical and Technical Safeguards you have put in place to protect the information. .</p>
              <p>Both HIPAA and HITECH are more about what you need to do and what you need to protect, rather than how. As a result ensuring your organization is compliant can be complicated. The complexity of systems involved in today’s highly technical medical settings means there is no silver-bullet solution that can solve all your compliance concerns. Instead you must diligently select various components with the goal of protecting your systems that access or store patient data so that you can ensure the security and privacy of your patient information.</p>
              <p>In hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare organizations, doctors and other staff often use mobile devices to access ePHI at work in the practice, at remote sites (such as a partner facility or a patient home) or after-hours work (such as working from home). Central or cloud based healthcare systems are generally designed to be compliant but do not provide protection of ePHI that is downloaded or stored on devices such as laptops, or even on the desktops in the office that never leave.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <img src="data/alertsec3.jpg" width="880" height="520" alt="img">
              &nbsp;
              <h2>Who Needs to be HIPAA Compliant</h2>
              <p>If you store or access any information that could be classified as ePHI, you are subject to the requirements of HIPAA and HITECH. Clearly that includes organizations such as hospitals, doctor’s offices and pharmacies, but it also covers other organizations, for example companies that perform billing services, or IT services such as cloud-hosted email or patient portals. Any system that can touch ePHI needs to be HIPAA compliant.</p>
              <p>If a HIPAA covered organization (a Covered Entity) engages a business associate to help carry out its health care activities and functions, there should be a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) between the two organizations. So if you have a signed BAA, then your business is also subject to HIPAA requirements for data protection.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <h2>HIPAA Rules</h2>
              <p>There are three main rule sets that come into play for HIPAA compliance: the Administrative Rules, the Privacy Rules and the Security Rules</p>
              &nbsp;
              <h5>Administrative Rules</h5>
              <p>The Administrative Rules cover the general policies and procedures regarding the securing of information. In some cases these may be borderline technical requirements, like the requirement to guard against malicious software, but the administrative rules are really focused on establishing security best practices as a baseline for the Privacy and Security Rules to build on.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <h5>Privacy Rules</h5>
              <p>The Privacy Rules focus on ensuring that PHI is protected from exposure outside the proper confines of use. These rules state the permitted uses and disclosures of PHI, regardless of the format (for example, paper, oral or electronic) and the types of controls that must be enforced for their protection.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <h5>Security Rules</h5>
              <p>The Security Rules focus on what safeguards must be in place. The Security Rules are divided into Administrative (section 164.308), Physical (section 164.310) and Technical Safeguards (section 164.312) to protect ePHI. The Security Rules are written so that they provide flexibility in implementation whilst ensuring the overall goals of ePHI protection are met.</p>
              <p>When combined, these rules detail what needs to be protected and provide guidance about the minimum requirements for protection.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <h2>AlertSec HIPAA Safeguards</h2>
              <p>The AlertSec Service provides a solid foundation for compliance with HIPAA requirements. With the AlertSec Service you are able to provide many of the Administrative Safeguards required in section 164.308 and most of the Technical Safeguards required in section 164.312. It is important to understand that full HIPAA compliance for all systems will require combining AlertSec with other tools to build a complete compliance picture.</p>
              <p>Section 164.308 Administrative Safeguards (a)(1) Standard: Security Management Process</p>
              <p><b>The AlertSec Service can assist with the following Security Management Process requirements:</b></p>

              </table>
              &nbsp;
              <h5>Audit Controls</h5>
              <p>The Audit Control requirement specifies that access to ePHI be recorded for review. While the AlertSec Service does not directly protect the ePHI application, but does support the requirement for audit records related to activity on the systems where the protected information will be accessed. The AlertSec Service provides a record of any authentication attempts and access to the system itself so you can review when the system/device was used (based upon successful logins) as well as any attempts to gain access (based on authentication failures).</p>
              <p>This information is supplemental to the specific Audit Controls mandated by HIPAA. The additional information provided by the AlertSec Service provides a broader coverage story about your compliance efforts and enhances your access to Affirmative Defense (as explained under Safe Harbor in the Building HIPAA Compliance section above).</p>

              &nbsp;
              <h2>Person or Entity Authentication</h2>
              <p>The Person or Entity Authentication requirement specifies that in addition to each user having a unique identifier (as required in the Access Control requirements), they must also have unique authentication credentials paired with the unique identifier. In normal terms, this means a user has to enter a password (or token or biometric, etc.) to validate their identity.</p>
              <p>AlertSec FDE and AlertSec Media Encryption both require the user to authenticate with a username and password to access the system or any encrypted media, providing assurance about who is accessing applications dealing with ePHI.</p>

The HIPAA act does not expect that a single application or service alone will provide all the security safeguards necessary to protect the information, and therefore provides the flexibility for an organization to design a complete security infrastructure using components that best meet its needs.</p>
              <p>With the AlertSec Service your organization can ensure the security of endpoint devices, providing a solid layer of technical security surrounding ePHI that is unobtrusive whilst also being highly effective. By minimizing the possibility of unsecured access on endpoint devices, AlertSec helps to achieve “Safe Harbor”, mitigating the need for breach notifications that would otherwise be mandatory whenever unsecured ePHI is accessed. Complete encryption of ePHI, as provided by AlertSec, is considered a primary way to achieve Safe Harbor.</p>
              <p>Implementing AlertSec FDE on endpoint devices within your organization ensures that any copies of ePHI, such as offline copies for remote work, data in Word® or Excel® documents, or cached data from applications, are always secured on the endpoint device. AlertSec Media Encryption can enable your organization to securely utilize removable media when transporting ePHI between systems (for example, when large volumes of data need to be backed up or delivered directly to another location, or where secure network transfers are not available or possible). And AlertSec Port Control and Application control provide your organization with the ability to block access to removable media ports and block unwanted applications in order to prevent any ePHI from being removed from the device.</p>
